# Data Structures and Algorithms - Study Repository

This repository contains my personal study notes and practice exercises on data structures and algorithms.

## What to expect:
- Problem-solving exercises written in **Python** and **C**
- Multiple approaches to the same problem, including inefficient or incorrect ones kept for learning and comparison purposes
- **Personal comments and notes in Portuguese**, which is my native language

## Important note:
Some solutions may contain mistakes or unoptimized code. This is intentional, as the goal is to document the learning process rather than provide final or polished implementations.

## Purpose:
To practice, experiment, make mistakes, and improve over time. If you're visiting this as part of a job search or technical evaluation, please note that this is a learning space, not a production-level portfolio.
